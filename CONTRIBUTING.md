# Contributing to Machine Learning for Beginners

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Machine Learning for Beginners** repository! Your contributions help
improve this resource and benefit learners in the ML and data science community.

Here’s a guide to help you get started with contributing:

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:**
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository to create a personal copy of the repository.

2. **Clone your fork:**
    - Clone the repository to your local machine by running:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/Aran1911/TheMLLab
      ```

3. **Create a new branch:**
    - It’s good practice to create a new branch for every feature or fix:
      ```
      git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name
      ```

4. **Make changes:**
    - Update or add new notes, examples, or fixes as needed.
    - Use clear comments in your code, and make sure explanations are simple and easy to understand for beginners.

5. **Commit your changes:**
    - After making changes, commit them:
      ```
      git commit -m "Your message explaining the changes"
      ```

6. **Push your changes:**
    - Push the changes back to your forked repository:
      ```
      git push origin feature-or-fix-name
      ```

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
    - Go to the original repository and create a pull request (PR) from your forked branch.

## Branching Model

- **main**: The stable branch that contains the latest stable version of the content and code.
- **dev**: The development branch where new features, fixes, and changes are made. All contributors should create new
  branches off of `dev` for their work.
- **feature-branches**: Always create a new branch from `dev` for each new feature, bug fix, or content update, and name
  the branch appropriately based on the changes you're making (e.g., `feature/add-scikit-learn`,
  `fix/typos-in-pandas-notes`).

## Types of Contributions

- **Fixing typos**: Spelling or grammatical corrections are always appreciated.
- **Improving explanations**: Making the notes clearer, adding examples, or expanding explanations.
- **Adding new topics**: If you have suggestions for new areas to cover (e.g., new ML algorithms, libraries like
  `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, etc.), feel free to add them.
- **Code improvements**: Optimizing code snippets, fixing errors, or adding better alternatives.

## Code of Conduct

Please ensure that all contributions follow the
GitHub [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/0/code_of_conduct.html). Be respectful,
constructive, and kind in your interactions.

Thank you for helping make this project better!
