# Machine Learning for Beginners - Notes and Resources

Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Beginners** repository! This open-source project is a collection of notes, resources, and practical examples to help students and aspiring data scientists get started with the fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML).

Currently, the focus is on **Pandas** (for data manipulation), which is an essential starting point for any ML journey. The repository will continue to grow, expanding into other ML libraries, algorithms, and concepts as you progress through your studies.

The goal is to create a comprehensive and beginner-friendly resource that you can refer to as you learn and experiment with ML.

## Key Features:
- Beginner-friendly explanations of essential ML concepts.
- Hands-on code examples and exercises in Jupyter notebooks.
- An open-source community where you can contribute, suggest improvements, and share insights.

## 📚 Table of Contents:
- [Pandas Series - Accessing and Modifying Elements](docs/pandas/pandas_series_accessing_modifying_elements.md)
- [Pandas - Essential Attributes and Functions](docs/pandas/pandas_essential_attributes_functions.md)

## 📝 Jupyter Notebooks
- [Pandas Basics](source/pandas_basic.ipynb): A beginner-friendly notebook that covers the basics of Pandas Series, including accessing and modifying elements, as well as understanding essential attributes and functions.
